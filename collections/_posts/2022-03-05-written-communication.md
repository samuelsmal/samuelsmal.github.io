  A somewhat opinionated list of rules on how to communicate.
field: Communication
---

Professional (or private) communication is key to everything. How, what and when you communicate can
have a much bigger impact than the code you write. If you can't communicate your success, or
identify the real problem<label
for="sn-message_xy_problem" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="sn-message_xy_problem" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem">See also the famous XY Problem.</a>
</span>, or are not able to communicate the impact of the issue at hand clearly, you might just as
well give up right now. Sadly the code does not speak for itself.

In this post I want to highlight certain aspects of *written communication* that I had to learn
myself and I now have to repeatedly point out to my colleagues. It's part guideline, part focusing
on the core principles for myself. Some of the advice also applies to verbal communication -
obviously. I have structured the guideline in *Rules*, that I hope is succinct and short enough to
stuck in your mind, followed by some more description. The first of these rules have a clearer goal
and a definitely easier to apply, the later ones are a bit more opinionated.

Let's start with a general communication rule:

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Although that there are always two sides to communication it is on the messenger to ensure
      that what was understood is what was meant to be communicated.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>


It is on the messenger to choose the right expressions for the receiver. Instead of *you have
misunderstood* think more along *I have explained that wrong*. If the receiver didn't fully
understood your point that you need to adapt your way of expression, you want to be understood, it's
your responsibility to phrase it accordingly and to ensure that you are indeed fully understood.
We are no longer in school and you are not teacher, thus it might be hard to verify that the
receiver has understood. You can't just ask, "can you repeat that for me in your own words?". But
you can adapt your expressions, the speed with which you talk, the technical depth, the amount of
context given, ...

For example if the receiver is a technical person they likely will want to know some more details, if
it's an ultra busy manager they will likely still want that technical information to pass it along,
but also an summary. Put yourself into the shoes of the receiver and try to come up with the wording
and content that the receiver would like to read. Try to gauge if your counterparty has understood
you. Try to read them. Which is tricky in an email. Try to have a face-to-face conversation
beforehand, and if not possible by very, very clear in your communication.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Every message should come with the right context.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

A message without context will never work. If you send an email to a colleague that you are in close
contact with there is probably not much context needed. In general, the less you see or talk to a
person the more likely is it that they have forgotten what this email will be about, so give
context.
It can be something trivial as "As our meeting two weeks ago about project x..." or "we did some
more research into the caching issue on server ..." or "as a follow-up on our talk earlier".


Expanding a bit on this, every bigger message should open with a statement on why you are contacting
this person, why is it important for them to read and answer you? What is the value for them?

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Open every message on why it is a concern for the recipient.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

If you're contacting them for the first time, give a brief introduction on who you are as well.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Ensure that the recipient knows who you are.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Onto the content. The following rules are somewhat overlapping and touch the same thing over and
over again. Try to incorporate them all.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Messages should have a single purpose.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

What do you want to convey? Hopefully this is a single thing. Grouping multiple
things into one message will make the written conversation more difficult. The question is what is
this *thing*? In general this depends if you want to give or receive something. I want to find out
why something didn't work, this something and the question about it are the single *thing*. If it's
about informing people about the recent changes we made to the platform or how to use some
complicated API or how the latest KPIs look this is that *thing*.
Think about the purpose of the message. This single purpose should be the focus of your thoughts
behind every message.

If you group more than one thing into one message the chances are that some will not be answered is
pretty high. Sometimes you will not even notice and then it's super awkward to ask again a few weeks
later. On the other hand, if you want to inform people about something it's usually much nicer to
have everything in one single message - the update is the single *thing*.

Of course there are scenarios where this is not doable - on the first glance. Let's say you
experienced some issues with a vendor of your and you a) need to have some answers to some questions
/ issues and b) need to make it clear to the decision-makers in your company that this is not the
right solution. What is the single purpose in this communiqu√©? It is not the answers, it's to
increase the pressure on the vendor while keeping your team in the loop.

Try to grok the principal purpose of the message. It can be obvious or more opaque. But it should
define the style and the content of the message.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Messages should be actionable. Include the what, the (until) when [and the how].
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Expanding on the purpose. If you want to receive anything from the recipient you need to guide them.
People don't like thinking for themselves, they like to think that they do, but most don't. It is
tiring and difficult, it also opens you up for potential failures.  So provide some pointers. Make
the message actionable and super clear. You are not writing a book, you are writing a professional
message. You want some feedback on some design, ask for it! And if you don't include the deadline it
will not happen within your desired time frame, be open and frank about this. "Please provide any
feedback on this by lunch time tomorrow. Otherwise we will not be able to guarantee successful
delivery. If you're not able to do so please let me know beforehand".  The actual deadline might the
tomorrow evening, or even the next week. But this way you get what you need in time.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Try to answer the Five W's: Who, What, Where, When, and Why.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

This rules comes straight from journalism, every article should answer the above "questions". In
this context it might not seem applicable, but use them as guidelines when you write your email or
prepare your talk and you might find that you left out certain parts.


<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Structure your message accordingly. Use BLUF, a.k.a. Minto Pyramid whereever you can.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>


The previous rules is only indicative of what the content should be, this rule touches the
structure. Everybody gets a lot of emails so try to show some empathy and structure your email in
such a way that people can start skimming or stop reading altogether. People call this the *Minto
Pyramid* or *BLUF, bottom line up front*, you start with the conclusion, followed by the key
arguments and lastly come the supporting points with detailed information. <label
for="sn-message_kabir" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="sn-message_kabir" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
  <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision">Kabir Sehgal wrote a similar post in the Harward Business Report</a>,
  and gives three main ways to format emails with military precision:
    1) Subject with key words - Key words specify the nature in email (e.g. Action, Sign, Info, Decision, etc.);
    2) Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) - Emails should be short that basically answers the 5W's: who, what, when, where, and why;
    3) Be Economical - short enough to understand and covey all the details. Using of Active voice is highly mandates rather than using passive voice.
</span> 

But when to apply it? I would use this structure when writing a design proposal, work plan, analysis
of some data, ... I wouldn't use it where I want to force people to read the whole thing and where
there is no clear indication on how to move forward.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Try to remove any points of confusion before they arise.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Onto style. This is more of a personal preference. If there are lists I use a number before each
item and not bullets if I think there will some sort of back-and-forth. It's much easier to
reference a number than bullets. Without providing a easy reference people will use the dreaded
inline mode or something along "the second point", why not provide these references from the start?

This expands obviously to the context as well. A reference point is not just for lists, providing
dates, clear numbers and figures goes a long way to remove any possible sources of confusion. If you
start the email-chain you can set the tone and method of the conversation.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Be kind not nice.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

How you word things is important, there are some who don't care how you phrase things. Some will be
pissed if you don't add their title to each letter. Some might need a bit more hand-holding. Some
might foresee any issues, some don't.
Nice vs kind is probably one of the most recent communication buzzwords. The idea is to be helpful
and friendly, while also not masking or talking around issues. If shit hits the fan, say it. "Call a
spade a spade." But do it nicely.

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Foster a relationship. Every time.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

On the same page, open or close the email in a personal way - if you can. Let's say you have been in
close contact with an engineer of one of your vendors. Why not replace the "Best regards, Sam" with
"Cheers, Sam"? If they have been on vacation or sick why not ask about it? Receptive people will
notice, and if they don't, who cares. Didn't cost you anything. It might seem superfluous, and not
the best example, but the goal is to foster a relationship, they should trust you, and believe that
you see them as a person. Thus try to engage the recipient in a personal way - but don't overdo it. 

<div class="epigraph rule">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
No spelling mistakes.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Use a spell & grammar checker. Everybody makes mistakes. Find some tools that do that for you. If it
means that you need to paste the message into Google Docs so be it. Maybe find a program that works
better with your workflow though. Don't forget to set it to the right dialect, which is `en_gb` for
English.

Combining all of the above into an example:

> **Regarding the recent outage**
>
> Dear Madam or Sir, (if you don't know who you're talking to) <br>
> [Hi | Good morning] Fred, (if you know them well / not so well)
>
> Sam here from Evilcorp, I am the responsible person for the monitoring of system X.
> I wanted to come back to you about the recent outage that we experienced on the 2021-01-23.
> As per out logs (attached) we can identify the issue to occur around 14:30 UTC.
> I had a look at our metrics and couldn't identify anything on our end.
> Can you have a look on your end and get back to me by the end of next week?
>
> [Best regards | Cheers], <br>
> Sam
