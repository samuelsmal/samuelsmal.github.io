  Basically some notes on how to ferment stuff.

During my time at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) I was asked to give a workshop on how to
ferment and show my kombucha, chili sauce, garlic paste, ... Since that was super fun and a huge
success and if Covid didn't happen it would have continued to a workshop at a fair in Lausanne. But
alas it was not to be.

Thus I am sharing the poster that I created with the help of my sister here. Maybe it can help
someone.
