My personal theory is that this is the result of an incompetent management class where no self
corrections are happening.

In my work experience I've realized everybody fears honesty in their organization be it big or
small.

Customers can't admit the project is failing, so it churns on. Workers/developers want to keep their
job and either burn out or adapt and avoid talking about obvious deficits. Management is preoccupied
with softening words and avoiding decisions because they lack knowledge of the problem or process.

Additionally there has been a growing pipeline of people that switch directly from university where
they've been told to only manage other people and not care about the subject to positions of power
where they are helpless and can't admit it.

Even in university, working for the administration I've watched people self congratulation on doing
design thinking seminars every other week and working on preserving their job instead of doing
useful things while the money for teaching assistants or technical personnel is not there.

I've seen that so often that I think it's almost universal. The result is mediocre broken stuff
where everyone pretends everything is fine. Everyone wants to manage, nobody wants to do the work or
god forbid improve processes and solve real problems.

I've got some serious ADHD symptoms and as a sysadmin when you fail to deliver it's pretty obvious
and I messed up big time more than once and it was always sweet talked, excused, bullshitted away
from higher ups.

Something is really off and everyone is telling similar stories about broken processes.

Feels like a collective passivity that captures everything and nobody is willing to admit that
something doesn't work. And a huge missallocation of resources.

Not sure how it used to be but I'm pessimistic how this will end.
