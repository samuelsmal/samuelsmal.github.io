# Factors

Recently I've been pondering about our meeting culture. The odd thing about consultancy is that you
are to a certain degree at the mercy of your client. You can't be fully open and transparent, some
people might say that you can, but you really can't. Some might argue that you just need to find the
right approach and words. But if the client has made up his mind on a certain idea you can't
contradict him the same way as you could if everybody present would be in the same company. The
client and you have different goals.

Some members in your team might also be very confrontational or shy or senior or junior. Different
personalities usually - under the right leadership - make up a good meeting, as you want to
represent every stakeholder.

Of course everybody will tell you that a successful meeting needs an agenda, people need to be
prepared, maybe even have a common structure. While I agree if all of them, I don't believe that one
can always achieve it. Humans are not machines, and we should celebrate our ability to adapt. If
your days are not filled with change, but are a constant flow that sure, you can stick to your
prearranged standard process. 
I am not talking about not having feedback loops or being static. If you are facing new challenges
of a different kind finding a nice abstraction that incorporates them that can't be summarised under
*let's sit together and talk it through in an orderly fashion* might just not be worth the effort.

Creating a process takes time and effort. So instead of creating a process I advocate for creating
guidelines.

That being said, there are some helpful words and vocabulary<label for="sn-vocabulary" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"

I use the word vocabulary loosely, to have a common understanding one needs to define some common
terms. This is what I try to achieve here.

# Vocabulary
## Types of meetings

There is this classical list on the internet:

1. Status updates
2. Information sharing
3. Decision making
4. Problem solving
5. Innovation
6. Team building

However, I would categorise them under:

1. One-way information sharing
2. Technical discussions, open-ended
3. Planing
4. Waste of time


### One-way information sharing

Some meetings are just to give some news. There is nothing to discuss. It's to ensure that
everybody has the same information. Sometimes somebody really wants to discuss something, because
they didn't get the memo.

It could be the new company-wide plan or you telling Azure that one of their products is not
working.

These meetings need to have an agenda. Doesn't need to be public, but you need to know what you want
to achieve. What's your goal? How can you make some progress?

As these meetings are to present some findings or to announce the new strategy there is seldom an
outcome except some next steps (which can often be summarised as "we'll look into it"). They are
seed-planting meetings.

Status updates, some information sharing and decision making meetings fall under this category.

### Technical discussions, open-ended

There is no agenda except for, let's look into this issue. One hopes that people are prepared either
to share some findings or has some new ideas where to look. The leader of the meeting is not
necessarily the person who asked for it, this is a challenge.

The outcome should be a solution or a clear path to it.


### Defining next steps

Could be a sprint planing, or an update meeting. Ideally every meeting has some follow ups. But for
these meetings are usually that someone has identified one or more potential future paths and
someone higher up the chain needs to make a decision.

These meetings are tricky to lead. As a consultant you have them basically every day with your
clients. The same question applies: *What is your goal?"* Ideally, you have a clear preferred
option, are ready to defend all of them, but are able to guide others towards one solution - based
on their input.

### Waste of time

Some meetings are just that. Try to avoid them. And label them as such if you can in your feedback.
The meme of counting the combined hours and multiply them by some magic rate can be effective, but
it's a trope that should be avoided as well.

Identifying which meetings are a common waste of time and only a waste of time for some individuals
is the tricky part.

## Why have them?

This is directly taken from [Kellan Elliot-McCrea's post on the values of
  meetings](https://kellanem.com/notes/briefly-meetings-and-some-alternatives):

1. Getting and clarifying information
2. Building shared understanding
3. Recognition and celebration
4. Reinforcing values
5. Building social bonds and trust

# Guidelines

1. State a goal. E.g. *Ensuring everybody got that.* or *To reach a conclusion.*
2. Define a meeting leader. Otherwise the meeting will go nowhere or everywhere.
3. Share an understanding of the type of meeting.
4. Create a common understanding of the outcome. If it's next goals, reiterate them and send an
   email detailing them if necessary.
