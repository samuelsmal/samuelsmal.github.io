# Premise

Over the last (almost) three years I've been involved in a data distribution platform as one of the
system and software architects.

## Particularities of the platform

- Strong peak behaviour

# Architecture

# Would I use it again?

- List the tools, what they did and if I would use them again

# The next architecture

## Scaling
### Horizontal vs vertical scaling

Horizontal scaling requires a restart of a service. This restart can be hidden away.

Verical scaling however provides is always transparent to the user if correctly setup.
