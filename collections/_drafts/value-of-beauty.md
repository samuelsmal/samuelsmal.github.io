# Introduction

Part of my job is learning, often times that means learning about some new technical product or
feature. But, from time to time it involves leadership or management training. And very rarely in
these trainings I get to reflect on myself in a true fashion. One of these task was to define a set
of core values.<label for="sn-my-values" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="sn-my-values" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In case you wanted to know which
values I defined for myself, see [here](/values).</span>

Of course I just searched on the internet for some examples. And as it turns out, a lot of companies
define a set of values that should guide them.

Here are the values from [OpenAI](openai.com) before the release of ChatGPT:

- **Audacious**. We make big bets and are unafraid to go against established norms.
- **Thoughtful**. We thoroughly consider the consequences of our work and welcome heterogeneity of thought.
- **Unpretentious**. We’re undeterred by the “boring work“ and not motivated to prove we have
the best ideas.
- **Pragmatic & Impact-Driven**. We’re a company of builders who care deeply about
real-world implications and applications.
- **Collaborative**. Many of our biggest advances grow out of work done across
multiple teams.
- **Growth-oriented**. We believe in the power of feedback and encourage a mindset
    of continuous learning and growth.

Which are actual good values. Most companies have some more standard ones. For example:
Accountability, Boldness, Collaboration, Continuous improvement, Curiosity, Customer commitment,
Diversity, Honesty, Humility, and Inclusion. What I find odd, there is no mention of **joy** or
**beauty**. There might be *passion* or *sustainability*. But no *happiness* or *delight*. Nor any
mentioning of *elegance* or *aesthetics*.

Even Apple, which produces beautiful products,
[doesn't](https://investor.apple.com/our_values/default.aspx) mention beauty. Instead they mention
the usual ones - including *privacy*. One could argue now on why that is. But instead I just want to
make the case for the value of beauty.

# The case for beauty

## A story

Part of my work as a consultant involves using technology provided by the client. As I deal with
sensitive data, the simplest option is often to hand me a laptop. And these laptops suck. The
battery is not good, the shell is made of weak and brittle plastic, the fan is loud, the keyboard
feels weird and the screen is just bad. In short, this laptop definitely helps with collaboration
and humility, it is pretty pragmatic as well.  But will it bring out any passion? Will it spark any
joy? Maybe not really the business friendly or oriented terms. So to ask differently: What is the
impact of that piece of technology on my productivity?

Pretty bad. It makes me not even wanting to start to work. I don't enjoy using it. It creates this
mental blocker as I try to avoid using it. Which I can't, which in turn makes me less motivated.

To remedy that, I use an external screen, and external mouse and the latest addition, an external
keyboard. But not any keyboard, a nice mechanical keyboard. And it brings me joy. It makes be more
productive in two distinct ways, a functional and psychological.
Since it is a mechanical keyboard the way the buttons move provides me with a lot of sensory
feedback. In this case it is mostly a tactile information. But this is already sufficient to
increase my typing speed and reduce any typing errors.
<label for="sn-mechanical-keyboards" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="sn-mechanical-keyboards" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In mechanical keyboards one uses two terms to describe the behaviour of the switches, the
mechanism that turns the button pressing into an electrical signal. There is the tactile feedback,
which can be linear or tactile. A linear switch feels the same regardless of how much you pressed
the key. A tactile switch has a trigger point, which you can feel as it requires more force to push.
On the other hand is the audible feedback. How does it sound? Does it make a click? Safe to say that
everyone has a different opinion on what the best switch is. The only correct answer is of course a
Cherry MX Blue switch, which has both an audible click and tactile bump - but it will annoy any
non-mechanical keyboard lovers around you.</span>

The psychological aspect is just the way it feels, the colours, and the sound. It sparks joy, using
it makes me happy, which in turn makes me more efficient and productive.

## What does the research say?

The argument that a more happy employee is a more efficient, productive and innovative one is not
new. There has been a lot of studies about that topic, here is just a quick summary.
<label for="sn-research" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="sn-research" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI created this amazing
tool called [OpenScholar](https://openscilm.allen.ai/) to synthesize
and search academic research. The paper for it can be found
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199). "While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time,
OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts."</span>

Studies have shown that employees who experience happiness at work are more likely to have higher
job satisfaction (Rosdaniati et al. 2021 [^1]) , be more engaged in their work (Magnier-Watanabe et al.
2020 [^2]) , and have better cognitive abilities, enabling enhanced creativity and problem-solving
(Magnier-Watanabe et al. 2020 [^2]).

Moreover, happiness has been linked to improved job performance, as it can increase motivation,
engagement, and productivity (Magnier-Watanabe et al. 2020 [^2]). For example, a study found that
employees who experienced happiness due to positive quality of work life were more likely to
engage in innovative behavior (Hasanati et al. 2025 [^7]) . Additionally, happiness has been shown to
have a positive impact on employee well-being, which is closely related to job satisfaction
(Rosdaniati et al. 2021 [^3]) . Happy employees are more likely to have a positive emotional state,
which can lead to better overall well-being and life satisfaction (Yu et al. 2024 [^6]).

Seems to me that being happy should be a pretty big factor for corporations.

## Translating it into business terms

Being happy can come from a lot of different sources. There are the classical three aspects of
fulfilling work: 1) relationships, or a sense of belonging and having a connection to others;
2) impact, which is progress toward a goal people believe in; and 3) growth, or a personal challenge
people overcome. One might expand this to include 4) agency, how big the influence is of
individuals. There is already a lot of literature on these aspects, but they miss **beauty**.


## What is beauty?

Beauty is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been debated and explored across various
disciplines, including philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, and art. At its core, beauty refers to
the quality or aggregate of qualities in a person, object, or experience that pleases the mind or
senses (Nasution. 2022 [^12]). It is often associated with properties such as harmony, excellence,
artistry, truth, fullness, and originality.

Beauty can be perceived and experienced in various forms, including physical beauty, elegance,
grace, and sexiness (Menninghaus et al. 2019 [^9]). Physical beauty is often subjective and
culturally relative, with different societies and individuals having unique standards and
perceptions of what constitutes beauty (Abid. 2021 [^10]). Elegance, on the other hand, is
characterized by refinement, simplicity, and sophistication, while grace is often associated with
movement, poise, and charm (Menninghaus et al. 2019 [^9]).

Beauty can also be found in non-human entities, such as nature, art, and music (Çorakli. 2014 [^8]).
The beauty of nature, for example, can evoke feelings of awe, wonder, and tranquility, while art and
music can provide a sense of pleasure, joy, and inspiration.

Moreover, beauty is not only a visual or auditory experience but also has a profound impact on our
emotional, psychological, and even spiritual well-being (Hirsch. 2021 [^11]). Beauty has the power
to evoke feelings of happiness, pleasure, and even spiritual growth, while also promoting social
justice and personal growth (Hirsch. 2021 [^11]).

In addition, beauty is a socially constructed concept, with cultural and historical contexts playing
a significant role in shaping our perceptions and definitions of beauty (Abid. 2021). Beauty
standards are often internalized by individuals, who strive to conform to societal expectations, and
the beholder's gaze is also enculturated to gauge beauty within the set parameters (Abid. 2021).

In conclusion, beauty is a rich and complex concept that encompasses various aspects of human
experience, including physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual dimensions (Çorakli. 2014).
It is a socially constructed concept that is shaped by cultural, historical, and personal contexts,
and its meaning and significance continue to evolve over time (Abid. 2021 [^10]).

## How does this apply to the tech world?

I would categorize this in two ways, the in and outside. The outside is what your clients can see,
be it a physical product or an API. The inside is how the team operates.

Probably nobody would say that they want to create products that are ugly. But there is a huge
difference between a beautiful designed API, which follows established standards, integrates well
into other systems, and has clear names versus an API that is poorly documented, changes drastically
from version to version and returns differently shaped objects. Having an eye for beauty in
combination with function and form is key to create a long-lasting client relationship. Apple has
understood this - at least on a physical level.

The inside could mean internal tooling, such as your CI/CD pipeline or build tools. Or internal
documentation. But it mostly means how the system is designed and implemented. How the different
parts interact.

One does not need to both, but if you neglect one part, the other will suffer as well.

# Guidelines for beautiful software products

How does one achieve a beautiful software product? This, of course, depends heavily on what you are
working on. Here are a few pointers that I try to follow in my projects:

- **Follow established standards**: Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Follow established patterns,
  and industry established. Your company and the problems you are solving are probably not that
  special.
- **Invest in naming**: A good naming schema is key, it needs to be concise, readable but can be
  fun. You can call the message broker `message-broker`, but you can also have some additional fun.
  For example the Cosmic Universe Naming Schema:

    - Stars for central services (e.g., "Sirius" for main database, "Vega" for authentication)
    - Planets for major application modules (e.g., "Mercury" for messaging, "Jupiter" for analytics)
    - Moons for supporting services (e.g., "Europa" for caching, "Titan" for logging)
    - Comets for scheduled batch jobs (e.g., "Halley" for daily reports)

  On a lower level this applies to how you name functions, objects, ... Really invest here.
- **Be consistent, over time and in content**: This mostly applies to how you exchange data, just
  stick to a single format, and if you are using JSON please use `lowerCamelCase`, and timestamps
  should be given in an ISO-8601 compliant format, and in UTC: `1900-01-01T12:34:12.002Z`.
- **Simplicity through reduction**: Have a clear message, which can be opinionated. Try to reduce
  what the system can and should do. The tools don't need to fit perfectly, it is better to have
  less that does more. However, this a tight balance and requires a lot of experience to get right.

While the above guidelines are somewhat generic and also just apply to any sane software product,
here is an even more generic, but very powerful one: Inspired by the [KonMari
Method](https://konmari.com) ask yourself: **Does it spark joy? Is this beautiful?**

If it doesn't, then improve it until it does. And do regular clean ups.
