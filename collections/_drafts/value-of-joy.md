- value is measured in metrics
- ui/ux is harder to measure
- the experience as a whole, holistic experience...
- developer experience

This is partly a rant, partly a call for some

Recently I found myself in the position to think more about value. My project leader has been
approaching me and asked me to think more along what the "business" sees as value. After some
questioning I realised that he means directly measurable outcomes. Like an new data source
connected, or reducing the number of CPU cores in use.

Later I realised that he meant also reducing or stop working on the over all platform and developer
experience improvements. A project-wide linter? Improving logging? Creating a test suite?

At this point I think I have to say that I don't mean creating a completely new logging system, but
maybe adding some more logging here and there, preparing some queries, maybe adding a new dashboard.
My project leader would disagree at this point.

The general remark however stuck with me. And it got me think of *what is value* and *what generates
value*.

<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote>
Value, noun

<ol>
<li>An amount, as of goods, services, or money, considered to be a fair and suitable equivalent for
something else; a fair price or return.</li>
<li>Monetary or material worth.</li>
<li>Worth in usefulness or importance to the possessor; utility or merit.</li>
</ol>

Obviously Merriam Webster doesn't reflect the full meaning of *value*. Value in the domain of
software engineering and software-driven business is hardly the same as general usage. Often times
the value of a product is defined as `value = function / cost`.

The value there is what additional utility the tool provides to its user, defined by the additional
function it provides. Cost is usually only defined with money, but I would argue it should include
the user experience as well. A product that is difficult to use has a higher cost, if it takes
longer to load, provides less guidance, has a at-odd internal model, it has a higher cost.
That cost may be harder to estimate and quantify but one should not forget the qualitative aspects
of *cost*.

And while my project manager may be good at evaluating the additional `function`, he is completely
disregarding the reduction in `cost`.

End-user vs developer

The value of joy
