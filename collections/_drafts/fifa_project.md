In this series of posts I want to highlight certain views or thoughts that trouble me. Usually these
posts will be out of my area of expertise, which is software engineering, machine learning and data
science and to a small degree being a tech lead.

# Introduction

Recently I started a new job at a consulting company. I was on-boarded to an on-going on my first
day with a eight hour long meeting day. Getting to know the client, what the project was about, what
our team should do and until when. The client was a smallish company mostly consisting of business
managers with a lot of contractors, organising regular huge world-wide sports events. The long-term
client's goal was to move a lot of knowledge further in-house and to combine the different data
streams into a coherent and consistent single source of truth.

Of course this was an enormous undertaking, the success of the project was not only measured on a
technical level (delivering multiple streaming data in real or near-real time)

is copied over.
