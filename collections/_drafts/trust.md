All about trust
    padding-left: 0;



- a lot of tough decisions have to be made without the required level of trust. e.g. hiring a person.
  nobody has enough time and resources in order to complete the search, reaching enough information.
- so how do we trust each other?
- certificates, too narrow to give reasonable information
- truth and the value of truth
- trust is consistency over time
