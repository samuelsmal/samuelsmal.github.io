When you start your career in the knowledge sector, right after university, you don't have an
impressive resume. There are a lot of similar people to you around, they might have similar grades
or better or worse ones. Some went to a more prestiguous university and studied under famous
professors. 

- without the right experience you don't get to do a cool job
- how do you get this experience? by being expose to things.
- that's why you get stuck with something boring.
- no exposure -> no experience -> no exposure

The relationship between exposure and experience is close, in order to get experience you need exposure. Thus I argue, exposure is everything.

Most decision makers are fundamentally _lazy._ When they're choosing the person to promote to manager, the employee to hire, the startup company to invest in, or the restaurant to have lunch at, the decision methodology used is _in no way_ optimal or hyper-rational. It's mostly just based what's familiar, nearby, and available.

"be lucky and don't fuck it up" - the hard work part equates a lot to "don't fuck it up" in my own interpretation of it all. There are many other ways to fuck up, of course, such as letting ego get in the way and so on.

“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” ― Seneca
