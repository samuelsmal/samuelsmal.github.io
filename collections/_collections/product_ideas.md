  A list (ha) of ideas that I would like to see come to live.
---

1. A dependency and end-of-life tracker for the various parts in a software architecture. Kinda like
   dependabot but for products. For all the managed services, OS versions, ... But it should be
   exportable to a standard calendar or give me a Gantt-chart and a JSON with the data.
2. A nice tool that let's me easily drill down on cloud compute costs. Ideally I can also play
   around with various actions, e.g. I would like to know what happens if I stick to this average
   monthly usage but reserve it for three years.
3. Ingest event streams (using [cloudevents](https://cloudevents.io/), store it in a nice way and
   create a simple queryable API (e.g. GraphQL or just HTTP REST).
