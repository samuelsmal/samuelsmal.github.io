  Just a list of principles that I collected over the years. Some apply to programming, some to
  software engineering, some to general life.

## Programming & Software Engineering


- Get it done.
- Nobody cares for your project / idea / app as long you can't show that it works.
- Strive for maintainable code. You and the next engineer touching it will thank you.
- Strive for pragmatic solutions.
- There is no complex system that didn't originate from a simple one, thus start simple and iterate.
  Basically I follow [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law).
