  Just a list of principles that I collected over the years. Some apply to programming, some to
  software engineering, some to general life.

## Programming & Software Engineering


- Get it done
- Nobody cares for your project / idea / app as long you can't show that it works, and that it does
  what you promise it should do.
- Prefer simple, maintainable functional code.
- Strive for maintainable code. You and the next engineer touching it will thank you. Try to go the
  extra mile to catch some future error. You probably only have that one chance to think about it
  and prevent it.
- Avoid complicated inheritance models that take forever to grok. Plain data-structures such as maps
  are easier to read and maintain.
- There is no complex system that didn't originate from a simple one, thus start simple and iterate.
  Basically I follow [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law).
