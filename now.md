# What I'm doing now

## Consulting

My day-job at [D-ONE](d-one.ai) exposes me to many challenges and roles. Most of the time I am a
tech lead, sometimes I am just a data analyst, rarely I am a software engineer.

Currently I am involved in two large projects:

1. Building a real-time data processing system for a medical device manufacturer, which will allow
   them make low latency, in-process, agentic decisions based on sensor data in the future.
   Supervising the ML-part, coming up with a good architecture, writing a new cloud-native
   guidelines for the client...
2. 

## Balancing attention



Aside from my day-job I have many side-projects.


### [Swiss Tea Club](teeclub.ch)

### Failing to found a startup

Together with a colleague from work, and a couple of others, I am trying to get enough money to
explore a business idea that would revolutionise (â„¢) how cloud infrastructure is provisioned. When I
say "I", I mean that I am supporting it. Trying to find the time for it is difficult.

### Doing lots of sport

After my hip surgery I am finally back to feeling healthy and fit. So I try to do as many hikes,
bike rides, camping trips, cross-country skiing days, ... as I can. Very Swiss. Also going back to
my old Shotokan Karate Dojo and seeing how my hold pupils are now much better than I could ever be
brings me lots of joy. Couldn't be more proud.

### Being a foster father
