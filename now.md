# What I'm doing now

## Consulting, aka earning money

My day-job at [D-ONE](d-one.ai) exposes me to many challenges and roles. Most of the time I am a
tech lead, sometimes I am just a data analyst, rarely I am a software engineer.

Currently my time is divided into multiple projects:

1. Building a real-time data processing system for a medical device manufacturer, which will allow
   them make low latency, in-process, agentic decisions based on sensor data in the future.
   Supervising the ML-part, coming up with a good architecture, writing a new cloud-native
   guidelines for the client...
2. Creating a 
3. Supporting the company with acquiring new projects and clients. That means mostly creating
   architectures, answering RfPs, visiting and presenting the company at prospective clients.

## Fermenting food

Roughly around 2012, when I realised that I could not figure out if the yoghurt had spoiled I
decided to train my body to smell and taste food. Learning about fermentation has since been a
source of inspiration for me. I did a lot of kombucha, sourdough bread (still going strong, Katja
II. is now more than six years old!) and chili sauce. It is the chili sauce that I want to create a
business around. Just for the kicks.


## Tea

My parents gave me my love for tea. Since 2024 I am a member of the board of the [Swiss Tea
Club](teeclub.ch). A highly prestigious job.


## Failing to found a startup

Together with a colleague from work, and a couple of others, I am trying to get enough money to
explore a business idea that would revolutionise (â„¢) how cloud infrastructure is provisioned. When I
say "I", I mean that I am supporting it. Trying to find the time for it is difficult.

## Doing lots of sport

After my hip surgery I am finally back to feeling healthy and fit. So I try to do as many hikes,
bike rides, camping trips, cross-country skiing days, ... as I can. Very Swiss. Also going back to
my old Shotokan Karate Dojo and seeing how my hold pupils are now much better than I could ever be
brings me lots of joy. Couldn't be more proud.

## Being a foster father

Probably, after my hip replacement, the biggest change in my life over the last years. By far the
most challenging task. Never before have I felt so helpless and powerful at the same time. My
girlfriend and myself hold no hard-power, only soft. Trying to support the two teenagers, with their
baggage, hopes, fears and dreams is a source of focus on what really matters.
