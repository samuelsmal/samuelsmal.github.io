# Me

Hi there!

I am Sam<label for="mn-image" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="mn-image" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">
<img src="/assets/img/samucon.jpg" alt="A picture of me">Artistic representation of myself.</span>,
a software engineer and machine learning engineer and data scientist and sometimes also a tech lead,
project lead, gardener, cook, ... In general a person with too many hobbies and interests and not
enough time. Based in Zurich, Switzerland, Europe.

On this website I am sharing some thoughts and ideas, just my own.

If you would like to discuss them you can reach out to me here, if time permits I am also open to
help you with some problem that you have. If you think that you could provide me with an interesting
challenge I am always open to listen to it.

In general I am very interested in interdisciplinary topics. Programming apps and programming
languages themselves lost a lot of interest for me, as I view them ever more as tools - I want
to create tools that have a direct impact. Learning how to use the tools is nice but I am strong
believer of learning by doing, to be more precise I am fan of project-based learning. I view myself
as an autodidact.

<p>
  When it comes to programming I follow some
  {% assign principles = site.collections | where:"title","Principles" %}
  {% for principles in principles %}
    <a href="{{ principles.url }}#programming--software-engineering">principles</a>.
  {% endfor %}

# Now

Here I will detail a bit what I am currently out and about.

I recently started a new job, first time in consulting. Let's see how that turns out. Mostly about
real-time distributed systems design and development with a pinch of project management.

Before that I worked at some startups, notably at [Contovista](https://www.contovista.com/), where I
was the second hired engineer and left when we're ~20 people. Before that and after I worked at some
over startups, e.g. [Merantix Labs (now Merantix Momentum)](https://merantix-momentum.com/). I know
share some insights that I gained during may stays and help some early startups to get them off the
ground.

In my free time I try to explore the world of fermentation and am exploring ways of how to sell it
with a friend of mine. To do something completely different from my daily tasks.  My garden grows
very nicely, but I must admit that I do not have the ability to shape it as my mother could do -
yet.

Technology wise I still read about representation learning, adversarial machine learning and the AI
alignment problem. But obviously now the real-time processing world and enterprise architecture and
general management techniques and tools are also on my plate.

Since December 2021 I am also a foster father to two teenagers, which is also quite an undertaking.
Thus parenting and child psychology books are now also on my list.
