# Me

Hi there!

I am Sam<label for="mn-image" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox"
id="mn-image" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">
<img src="/assets/img/samucon.jpg" alt="A picture of me">Artistic representation of myself.</span>,
a software engineer and machine learning engineer and data scientist and tech lead, project lead,
gardener, cook, ... In general a person with too many hobbies and interests and not enough time.
Based in Zurich, Switzerland, Europe.

On this website I am sharing some thoughts and ideas, just my own.

If you would like to discuss them you can reach out to me here, if time permits I am also open to
help you with some problem that you have. If you think that you could provide me with an interesting
challenge I am always open to listen to it.

In general I am very interested in interdisciplinary topics. Programming apps and programming
languages themselves lost a lot of interest for me, as I view them ever more as tools - I want
to create tools that have a direct impact. Learning how to use the tools is nice but I am strong
believer of learning by doing, to be more precise I am fan of project-based learning. These days I
spend a lot of time thinking about the socio-technical challenges that good software brings.
